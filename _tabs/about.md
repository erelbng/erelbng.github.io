I'm Eric Elbing, a mechanical engineer specializing in mechatronics. I earned my master’s degree from the [University of Applied Sciences in Leipzig](https://fing.htwk-leipzig.de/startseite) (Germany), where I'm still conducting extensive research on mobile robotics under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Martin Gürtler](https://fing.htwk-leipzig.de/fakultaet/professuren/prof-martin-guertler/) and [Prof. Dr. André Ludwig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/personenprofil/mitarbeiter/andre-ludwig). My research is supported by the EU and the state of Saxony through the [ESF Plus fund](https://european-social-fund-plus.ec.europa.eu/en).  

Beyond my research, I work as a mechanical engineer at [Zöschener Maschinen und Anlagenbau GmbH](https://www.zoema.de/).  

Many of my projects have remained behind the scenes—something I want to change. That’s why I created this website: to share insights from my research, showcase my work, and connect with different individuals worldwide. I stumbled across the website of [Jérome Eertmans](https://eertmans.be/), which i used strongly as inspiration.
