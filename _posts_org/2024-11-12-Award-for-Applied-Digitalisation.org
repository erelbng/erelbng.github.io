I am honored to announce that I have been awarded 1st place in the 2024 *Förderpreis für Angewandte Digitalisierung* by [[https://www.actemium.de/news/htwk-forderpreis-2024/][Actemium Deutschland]] and [[https://www.htwk-leipzig.de/hochschule/aktuelles/newsdetail/artikel/die-gewinner-des-foerderpreises-fuer-angewandte-digitalisierung-2024][HTWK Leipzig]]. This award recognizes degree theses that make significant contributions to the practical application of digital technologies in industry and business.

At the Pitch Day on 24 October 2024 in Leipzig (Germany), I presented my master’s thesis, titled *mobile FACTORy: Framework for Advanced Control and Training of Mobile Robots*, which focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to enhance the training and control of mobile robots. The core concept involves breaking down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, each managed by trained software agents. This methodology draws inspiration from the Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) approach, which segments processes into fundamental activities for improved efficiency and planning.

I extend my sincere gratitude to my advisor, [[https://fing.htwk-leipzig.de/fakultaet/professuren/prof-martin-guertler/][Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Martin Gürtler]], whose expertise and guidance were invaluable throughout the research process. His insights significantly contributed to the successful completion of this project.

Additionally, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the other award recipients:
- 2nd Place: Anton Thomé, for his research on optimizing dynamic weighing processes for precise in-process quality control.
- 3rd Place: Lucas Döring, for his work on generating BIM models from point clouds of existing steel structures.
